/**
 RSAkeyGen.java generates an RSA key set.

 Assume that RSAPublicKey.txt and RSAPrivateKey.txt have been generated with RSAkeyGen

 RSAPSSA.java generates an RSA-PSS signature

 RSAPSSA RSAPrivateKey.txt < sample.txt > RSAPSSSignature.txt

 Complete decrypt() and steps 4-13 in RSAPSSB.java to verify an RSA-PSS signature.  (I already filled some of these steps.)

 java RSAPSSB RSAPublicKey.txt RSAPSSSignature.txt < sample.txt

 Submit your RSAPSSB.java and the verification using a sample.txt of your choice. (like RSAPSSA.java as sample.txt)

 Complete the steps in ECDSA() of EC2.java and show an example sun that verifies a signature.
